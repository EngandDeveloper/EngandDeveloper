### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

**I am doing a double major on my two favourite subjects: Software Engineering & Management.**

I have explored many different sub-fields of software engineering to discover new methods, gain broader perspective of software engineering landscape and to find what I love. So far I have studies and/or done some small to mid size projects in the following areas:
* **Mobile Development**
  * Native Android Development with Java
  * Multi-platform development with React Native
* **Scripting**
  * BASH Scripting
  * Python Scripting 
* **Software Engineering Fundementals**
  * Nasm Assembly
  * Python
  * C
* **Object Oriented Programming**
  * Java
  * Python
  * C#
* **Game Development**
  * Using PyGame Module
  * Basic Games with JavaScript 
  * Using Unity Game Engine & C# (Both for Mobile and Desktop)
* **Web Development**
  * With Vanilla JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Firebase
  * Utilizing CSS frameworks such as Bootstrap & Skeleton
  * Web Apps with Django, React & MySQL
  * MERN Stack Applications
  * Geo-location based applications with Microsoft Bing Maps API, Open Street API and Google Maps API
* **Machine Learning/AI**
  * Python
    * Supervised Learning with SciKitLearn & Numpy
    * Neural Networks with Numpy, PyTorch, TensorFlow
    * Reinforcement Learning with Open AI Gym Library, Tianshou ML Library, TensorFlow & PyTorch
* **Enterprise Software**
  * Salesforce   

Lately, I have been working on a Machine Learning based research project and Web Development.
